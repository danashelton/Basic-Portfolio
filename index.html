Like one of those "you've got to be kidding me," kind of days? This morning I was getting ready to go to a funeral for a lovely 94 year old woman, when I literally had to leave and go to the hospital because my step dad died in a motorcycle accident. 61 years old, hit an animal or something and flew 30 feet, breaking his neck in two places. I'm pissed, and I'm sad. It's been one of those days where I'm waiting for someone to jump out and yell "Just Kidding!"
                <br>

                However... It's late. I'm tired. And no one has revealed some sick elaborate rouse. Yet I am still sitting here trying to write an autobiography despite my brain being in complete shock and feeling a bit fuzzy because that's who I am. I don't give up, I don't like making excuses, and I write crappy bios sometimes but at least I try. That's the beauty of the internet over print, isn't it? So much easier to rewrite on a better day... and cheaper.
